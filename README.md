Spark Library - Book Lending & Review Platform

A full-stack web application built with a Node.js backend and a vanilla JavaScript frontend. This platform allows users to register, browse a library of books, borrow available titles, and leave reviews. The application features a robust role-based access control system, providing a separate, secure dashboard for administrators to manage the book inventory and user return requests.

Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the Repository

Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

2. Install Dependencies

Bash

npm install

3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following configuration variables.
Code snippet

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=library_db
JWT_SECRET=a_very_secret_key_that_is_long_and_secure
PORT=3000

4. Run the Application

The server uses sequelize.sync() to automatically create and update your database tables based on the models.
Bash

# For development with auto-restarting
nodemon index.js

# For standard execution
node index.js

The server will start on http://localhost:3000.
