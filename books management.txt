Book Lending & Review Platform for Libraries
Project Overview

Build a backend system for public or private libraries and book clubs to manage book lending, user memberships, borrowing history, and community reviewsâ€”designed for both library administrators and members.
Core Features

    Authentication & Roles

        JWT-based authentication.

        Roles: Admin, Member, Librarian. Granular permissions (e.g., only admins can add/remove books, librarians approve borrow/return requests).

    Book Inventory & Borrowing

        Users can browse/search available books.

        Place borrow requests, track due dates, and request extensions.

        Status tracking: available, borrowed, overdue, reserved.

    Community Reviews

        Members can add reviews and ratings for books.

        List top-rated books, most borrowed, or trending books.

    Membership & Borrowing History

        Users can register and view their borrowing/review history.

        Admin reports: most active borrowers, most borrowed books.

    Notifications

        Email notifications for overdue books, new arrivals, review approvals.

Where MySQL JOINs Shine

    Show all books currently borrowed by a member (JOIN users, books, lendings).

    List all reviews for a specific book including reviewer details (JOIN books, reviews, users).

    Get a report of overdue books with associated members (JOIN books, lendings, users).

Suggested Tables

    Users (user_id, name, email, password, role)

    Books (book_id, title, author, genre, status)

    Lendings (lending_id, user_id, book_id, borrow_date, due_date, returned_date)

    Reviews (review_id, book_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at)

Why This Is a Standout Project

    Practical Application: Real-world use case for libraries/clubs and showcases advanced backend competencies.

    Complex Data Relationships: MySQL JOINs for lending and review analytics.

    Secure & Robust Stack: Node.js, Express, JWT, and MySQL all in action.

    Portfolio-Ready: Goes beyond trivial CRUD; demonstrates professional server-side design and reporting.
